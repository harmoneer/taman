# Taman

🌱 **Taman** is a terminal-based Pomodoro productivity app where your focus sessions literally grow plants! Built in Rust with Ratatui, it combines the Pomodoro technique with gamification — complete focus sessions to evolve your plant from a 🌰 seed to a 🪴 fully grown plant.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Configurable focus, short break, and long break durations
- **Plant Growth**: Emoji-based plants that grow with each completed session
- **Auto-Run Queue**: Queue multiple sessions to run automatically
- **Statistics & Charts**: Daily metrics with bar charts and pie charts for productivity insights
- **Themes**: Multiple color themes (System, Rose Pine Light, Rose Pine Dark)
- **Persistence**: JSON-based saving of progress, stats, and settings
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Fully navigable with keyboard only
- **Streak Tracking**: Current and longest daily streaks
